<pre>These are the videos that I submitted to NYU when I got admitted. 
They are cringy, yes, but I have been to busy with other things to make the better stuff I have wanted to. 
As you can see they all have the same consistent style however that I think is unique. 
These are just to show that I am not 100% incompetent when making a video. 
I have gotten about 7x better than what you see. Also, I have gotten 10x better looking :( </pre>
